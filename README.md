# Ribbing

## Teaching robots some manners
Ribbing is a project with the goal of creating a way for autonomous agents from different origins to agree upon and adopt a number of similar rules of behaviour.

### Tiers
I am considering having a number of tiers that an agent can fulfill. For example there could be *R1* for hygiene factors, *R2* for matters of courtesy and *R3* for conventions and norms. There will also probably be an *R0* tier which describes a handshake and a way to exchange some information or to compare frames of reference. To be able to fullfil a higher tier, all tiers below it need to also be fulfilled.

## Why?
Because I believe that society and social entities work better together when a few baseline conventions are adopted. If we want a new dynamic system to emerge, why not ground it in a good and sane base layer?

## World view and underlying ethical code
Some key concepts are going to be central to this discussion. Among them are probably emergence and discourse ethics. This part of the discussion will be filled out as we go.
